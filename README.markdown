### This is an open-source desktop app designed to help users reference multiple files — including their relative paths and full content — in order to generate well-structured prompts for large language models.

- Especially well-suited for models that support very long context lengths.
- Each referenced file includes both its relative path and complete content. Providing relative paths gives the model a clear understanding of the project’s file and folder hierarchy — particularly valuable for complex coding or writing projects.
- There are currently no plans to release pre-built Linux binaries. However, building for Linux is straightforward — see the instructions in package.json.
- I’m considering adding web search functionality to the app, which would allow the generated prompts to include RAG-like (retrieval-augmented) external information.
Before proceeding, I’d like to better understand whether there is genuine demand for this feature.
